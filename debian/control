# This package was folded into the g-speak platform
# during the g-speak 4.5 development cycle.
# As part of the platform train, it gets a rel-4.6.1
# tag and version number... which changes the
# vestigal trailing zero in the package name to 4,
# confusing downstream users.  Rather than just
# remove the suffix, the package was renamed to
# the new naming scheme introduced with g-speak 4.6.
# Conflicts:, Replaces:, and Provides: headers were
# added so installing the new package does not fail
# if the old package was already installed.
# See the 'clean slate' upgrade method in
# https://wiki.debian.org/RenamingPackages
